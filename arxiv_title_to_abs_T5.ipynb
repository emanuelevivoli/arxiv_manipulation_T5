The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n\nRef: Phys.Rev.D76:013009,2007\n"]}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**We will take last 5 years ArXiv papers (2016-2021) due to Kaggle'c compute limits**"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["titles = []\n","abstracts = []\n","years = []\n","metadata = get_metadata()\n","for paper in metadata:\n","    paper_dict = json.loads(paper)\n","    ref = paper_dict.get('journal-ref')\n","    try:\n","        year = int(ref[-4:]) \n","        if 2010 < year < 2021:\n","            years.append(year)\n","            titles.append(paper_dict.get('title'))\n","            abstracts.append(paper_dict.get('abstract'))\n","    except:\n","        pass \n","\n","len(titles), len(abstracts), len(years)"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(42014, 42014, 42014)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["papers = pd.DataFrame({\n","    'title': titles,\n","    'abstract': abstracts,\n","    'year': years\n","})\n","papers.head()"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0                  The World as Evolving Information   \n","1  A unified analysis of the reactor neutrino pro...   \n","2  Heat Equations and the Weighted $\\bar\\partial$...   \n","3  The KATRIN sensitivity to the neutrino mass an...   \n","4  Penguin-mediated B_(d,s)->VV decays and the Bs...   \n","\n","                                            abstract  year  \n","0    This paper discusses the benefits of describ...  2012  \n","1    We present in this article a detailed quanti...  2013  \n","2    The purpose of this article is to establish ...  2012  \n","3    The aim of the KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino ex...  2011  \n","4    In this letter, we propose three different s...  2011  "],"text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>title</th>\n      <th>abstract</th>\n      <th>year</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>The World as Evolving Information</td>\n      <td>This paper discusses the benefits of describ...</td>\n      <td>2012</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>A unified analysis of the reactor neutrino pro...</td>\n      <td>We present in this article a detailed quanti...</td>\n      <td>2013</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Heat Equations and the Weighted $\\bar\\partial$...</td>\n      <td>The purpose of this article is to establish ...</td>\n      <td>2012</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>The KATRIN sensitivity to the neutrino mass an...</td>\n      <td>The aim of the KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino ex...</td>\n      <td>2011</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Penguin-mediated B_(d,s)-&gt;VV decays and the Bs...</td>\n      <td>In this letter, we propose three different s...</td>\n      <td>2011</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["del titles, abstracts, years"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["cpu_stats()"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'memory GB:0.14'"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" **We will use `simpletransformers` library to train a T5 model**"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["import logging\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n","transformers_logger = logging.getLogger(\"transformers\")\n","transformers_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n"],"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Simpletransformers implementation of T5 model expects a data to be a dataframe with 3 columns:**\n","`<prefix>, <input_text>, <target_text>`\n","* `<prefix>`: A string indicating the task to perform.

With the emergence of many different\ntransport codes in recent years, it becomes important to estimate their\nrobustness in extracting physics information from experiments. We report on the\nresults of a transport code comparison project. 18 commonly used transport\ncodes were included in this comparison: 9 Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck-type\ncodes and 9 Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics-type codes. These codes have been\nrequired to simulate Au+Au collisions using the same physics input for mean\nfields and for in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, as well as the same\ninitialization set-up, the impact parameter, and other calculational parameters\nat 100 and 400 AMeV incident energy. Among the codes we compare one-body\nobservables such as rapidity and transverse flow distributions. We also monitor\nnon-observables such as the initialization of the internal states of colliding\nnuclei and their stability, the collision rates and the Pauli blocking. We find\nthat not completely identical initializations constitute partly for different\nevolutions. Different strategies to determine the collision probabilities, and\nto enforce the Pauli blocking, also produce considerably different results.\nThere is a substantial spread in the predictions for the observables, which is\nmuch smaller at the higher incident energy. We quantify the uncertainties in\nthe collective flow resulting from the simulation alone as about $30\\%$ at 100\nAMeV and $13\\%$ at 400 AMeV, respectively.

It can also be viewed as a matrix formulation of multidimensional\nscaling, which is to embed n points in a $r$-dimensional space such that the\nresulting distances follow the ordinal constraints. The ordinal constraints,\nthough proved to be quite useful, may result in only zero solution when too\nmany are added, leaving the feasibility of EDMOC as a question. In this paper,\nwe first study the feasibility of EDMOC systematically. We show that if $r\\ge\nn-2$, EDMOC always admits a nontrivial solution. Otherwise, it may have only\nzero solution. The latter interprets the numerical observations of 'crowding\nphenomenon'. Next we overcome two obstacles in designing fast algorithms for\nEDMOC, i.e., the low-rankness and the potential huge number of ordinal\nconstraints. We apply the technique developed to take the low rank constraint\nas the conditional positive semidefinite cone with rank cut. This leads to a\nmajorization penalty approach. The ordinal constraints are left to the\nsubproblem, which is exactly the weighted isotonic regression, and can be\nsolved by the enhanced implementation of Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm\n(PAVA).

In this\npaper, we investigated the dependence of physiological tremor during tonic,\nisometric plantarflextion torque at 30% of maximum at three ankle angles. The\namplitude of physiological tremor increased as calf muscles shortened in\ncontrast to the stretch reflex whose amplitude decreases as muscle shortens. We\nused a closed-loop simulation model of afferented muscle to explore the\nmechanisms responsible for this behavior.

The\nhomogeneous cooling state of a freely cooling granular gas is investigated with\nthe system of the Grad (d+3)(d^2+6d+2)/6-moment equations and its various\nsubsystems. By performing a linear stability analysis in the vicinity of the\nhomogeneous cooling state, the critical system size for the onset of\ninstability is estimated through the considered Grad moment systems. The\nresults on critical system size from the presented moment theories are found to\nbe in reasonably good agreement with those from simulations.\n\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Generating outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"01a1011c60984ed6b94993483278c299"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Decoding outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"23ce3ebe831d4b978e34a8357a59798a"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\nActual Title: Full-Duplex Transceiver System Calculations: Analysis of ADC and\n  Linearity Challenges\nPredicted Title: Nonlinear distortion in full-duplex transceiver chains\nActual Abstract:   Despite the intensive recent research on wireless single-channel full-duplex\ncommunications, relatively little is known about the transceiver chain\nnonidealities of full-duplex devices.

However in many practical situations of interest, models are\nconstrained structurally so that they only have a few degrees of freedom\nrelative to their ambient dimension. This paper provides a general framework to\nconvert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in\nconvex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The\nclass of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms\nfrom some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include\nwell-studied cases such as sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, as well as\nseveral others including sums of a few permutations matrices, low-rank tensors,\northogonal matrices, and atomic measures. The convex programming formulation is\nbased on minimizing the norm induced by the convex hull of the atomic set; this\nnorm is referred to as the atomic norm. The facial structure of the atomic norm\nball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering\nsimple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp\nestimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust\nrecovery of models from partial information. These estimates are based on\ncomputing the Gaussian widths of tangent cones to the atomic norm ball. When\nthe atomic set has algebraic structure the resulting optimization problems can\nbe solved or approximated via semidefinite programming. The quality of these\napproximations affects the number of measurements required for recovery.

The DiFFs are\nextracted as Monte Carlo (MC) averages of corresponding multiplicities using\ntheir probabilistic interpretation. To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of\nthe produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with\nelementary Collins modulation. We calculate the dependence of the polarised\nDiFFs on various angles such as the azimuthal angle of the single hadron and\nthe angle of the two hadron production plane $\\varphi_R$ for several values of\n$P_{SF}$.

During the hydrodynamic stage,\nthe production of lepton pairs is described by radiation rates for a strongly\ninteracting medium in thermal equilibrium.

In the intermediate mass region, the\nhadronic rate is essentially determined by multi-pion annihilation processes.\nEmission from quark-antiquark annihilation in the quark gluon plasma is taken\ninto account as well.

For large engineering manipulators, the main challenge is to\naccurately recognize the posture of all arm segments. In classical sensing\nmethods, the accuracy of an inclinometer is easily affected by the elastic\ndeformation in the manipulator's arms. This results in big error accumulations\nwhen sensing the angle of joints between arms one by one. In addition, the\nsensing method based on machine vision is not suitable for such kind of outdoor\nworking situation yet. In this paper, we propose a novel posture positioning\nmethod for multi-joint manipulators based on wireless sensor network\nlocalization. The posture sensing problem is formulated as a\nNearest-Euclidean-Distance-Matrix (NEDM) model. The resulting approach is\nreferred to as EDM-based posture positioning approach (EPP) and it satisfies\nthe following guiding principles: (i) The posture of each arm segment on a\nmulti-joint manipulator must be estimated as accurately as possible; (ii) The\napproach must be computationally fast; (iii) The designed approach should not\nbe susceptible to obstructions. To further improve accuracy, we explore the\ninherent structure of manipulators, i.e., fixed-arm length. This is naturally\npresented as linear constraints in the NEDM model. For concrete pumps, a\ntypical multi-joint manipulator, the mechanical property that all arm segments\nalways lie in a 2D plane is used for dimension-reduction operation. Simulation\nand experimental results show that the proposed method provides efficient\nsolutions for posture sensing problem and can obtain preferable localization\nperformance with faster speed than applying the existing localization methods.\n\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Generating outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"9e06fcbf75e24e8e89081993e97b554e"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Decoding outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"c18120cdec894086a4d560121e3a45f7"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\nActual Title: Formal Concept Analysis Based Association Rules Extraction\nPredicted Title: Formal Concept Analysis for Formal Concept Analysis\nActual Abstract:   Generating a huge number of association rules reduces their utility in the\ndecision making process, done by domain experts.

It is premised on avoiding planets lacking subaerial weathering\nof continents, which would imply geochemical cycles drastically different from\nEarth$'$s, precluding use of oxygen as a biosignature. The strategy starts with\nthe most readily obtained data: semi-major axis and stellar luminosity to\nensure residence in the habitable zone; stellar XUV flux, to ensure an\nexoplanet can retain a secondary (outgassed) atmosphere. Next, high-precision\nmass and radius information should be combined with high-precision stellar\nabundance data, to constrain the exoplanet$'$s water content; those\nincompatible with less than 0.1 wt % H$_{2}$O can be deprioritized. Then,\nreflectance photometry or low-resolution transmission spectroscopy should\nconfirm an optically thin atmosphere.

White-light continuum\nemission is sometimes observed and the flares are then termed \"white-light\nflares\" (WLF).

While centralized reinforcement learning methods can optimally solve\nsmall MAC instances, they do not scale to large problems and they fail to\ngeneralize to scenarios different from those seen during training. In this\npaper, we consider MAC problems with some intrinsic notion of locality (e.g.,\ngeographic proximity) such that interactions between agents and tasks are\nlocally limited. By leveraging this property, we introduce a novel structured\nprediction approach to assign agents to tasks. At each step, the assignment is\nobtained by solving a centralized optimization problem (the inference\nprocedure) whose objective function is parameterized by a learned scoring\nmodel.

In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres\ncontain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very\nlittle is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share\ncommon properties between different species across different phyla. We used\nbioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species\nusing publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. The assumption that\nthe most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA was true for most species\nwhose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a\ngeneral property of genomes. Our methods are compatible with all current\nsequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to\nfind tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. High-copy centromere tandem repeats\nwere found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were\nhighly variable in sequence composition and in length. Furthermore,\nphylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence\nconservation beyond ~50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an\noverall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse\nspecies showed similar modes of evolution, including the appearance of higher\norder repeat structures in which several polymorphic monomers make up a larger\nrepeating unit. While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically\ndetermined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at\ncentromeres of both animals and plants. This suggests a functional role for\nsuch repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across\nchromosomes.\n\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Generating outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"62a02781afb64c759cfacc428b78d8b0"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Decoding outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"45a98c52a19e451ab88c0cd8819c9695"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\nActual Title: Monte Carlo Simulation for Elastic Energy Loss of Hard Partons in a\n  Hydrodynamical Background\nPredicted Title: rightarrow 2$ scatterings of perturbatively produced, non-ei\nActual Abstract:   We have developed a Monte Carlo simulation describing the $2 \\rightarrow 2$\nscatterings of perturbatively produced, non-eikonally propagating high-energy\npartons with the quarks and gluons of the expanding QCD medium created in\nultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.

For habitable exoplanets in particular, located at small angular\nseparation from the host star, it is crucial to employ small inner working\nangle (IWA) coronagraphs that efficiently suppress starlight. These\ncoronagraphs, in turn, require careful control of the wavefront which directly\nimpacts their performance. For ground-based telescopes, atmospheric refraction\nis also an important factor, since it results in a smearing of the PSF, that\ncan no longer be efficiently suppressed by the coronagraph. Traditionally,\natmospheric refraction is compensated for by an atmospheric dispersion\ncompensator (ADC). ADC control relies on an a priori model of the atmosphere\nwhose parameters are solely based on the pointing of the telescope, which can\nresult in imperfect compensation. For a high contrast instrument like the\nSubaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system, which employs\nvery small IWA coronagraphs, refraction-induced smearing of the PSF has to be\nless than 1 mas in the science band for optimum performance. In this paper, we\npresent the first on-sky measurement and correction of residual atmospheric\ndispersion. Atmospheric dispersion is measured from the science image directly,\nusing an adaptive grid of artificially introduced speckles as a diagnostic to\nfeedback to the telescope's ADC. With our current setup, we were able to reduce\nthe initial residual atmospheric dispersion from 18.8 mas to 4.2 in broadband\nlight (y- to H-band), and to 1.4 mas in H-band only.

This proposed Knudsen number for an unsteady flow is rooted in a\nfundamental symmetry principle, namely Galilean invariance.\n\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Generating outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"a1545dab6f7e45ed96552deb2a02cbce"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Decoding outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"034ffb5354e54cdaacb4a08a635cb553"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\nActual Title: Black hole masses of weak emission line quasars based on continuum fit\n  method\nPredicted Title: Optical-ultraviolet spectral energy distribution of weak emission-line\nActual Abstract:   We studied optical-ultraviolet spectral energy distribution of 10 weak\nemission-line quasars (WLQs) which lie at redshifts z = 0.19 and 1.43 < z <\n3.48. The theoretical models of their accretion disk continua are created based\non the Novikov-Thorne equations. It allows us to estimate masses of their\nsupermassive black holes (MBH) and accretion rates. We determined the virial\nfactor for WLQs and note its anti-correlation with the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of Hbeta emission-line (f propto FWHM^(alpha), alpha = (-1.34\n+/- 0.37)). By comparison with the previously estimated BH masses, the\nunderestimation of MBH is noticed with a mean factor 4-5 which depends on the\nmeasured full width. We proposed the new formula to estimate MBH in WLQs based\non their observed FWHM (H beta) and luminosities at 5100 A. In our opinion,\nWLQs are also normal quasars visible in a reactivation stage.\n\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Generating outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"8149e061d0184e3eae32d16fd0c1a27a"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Decoding outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"aaf78deff1a64d979e7f1ec042e2b0c1"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\nActual Title: Theoretical Investigation: 2D N-Graphdiyne Nanosheets as Promising Anode\n  Materials for Li/Na Rechargeable Storage Devices\nPredicted Title: Newly fabricated N-graphdiyne monolayers as anode\nActual Abstract:   N-graphdiyne monolayers, a set of carbon-nitride nanosheets, have been\nsynthesized recently through the polymerization of triazine- and pyrazine-based\nmonomers. Since the two-dimensional nano-structures are mainly composed of\nlight-weight nonmetallic elements including carbon and nitrogen, they might be\nable to provide high storage capacities for rechargeable cells. In this study,\nwe used extensive first principle calculations such as electronic density of\nstates, band structure, adsorption energy, open-circuit voltage, nudged-elastic\nband and charge analyses to investigate the application of the newly fabricated\nN-graphdiyne monolayers as the anode material for Li/Na/Mg ion batteries. Our\ncalculations suggest that while Mg foreign atoms poorly interact with\nmonolayers, Li and Na adatoms illustrate outstanding anodic characteristics for\nrechargeable storage cells. Electronic density of states calculations indicate\nthat the insertion of Li/Na into the novel N-graphdiyne materials enhances the\nelectrical conductivity of nanosheets. Adsorption energy and open-circuit\nvoltage calculations predict that the nanosheets can provide a high storage\ncapacity spectrum of 623-2180 mAh/g which is higher than that for most recently\ndiscovered 2D materials (e.g. phosphorene, borophane, and germanene involve Li\nbinding capacities of 433, 504, and 369 mAh/g, respectively) and it is also\nsignificantly greater than the capacity of commercial anode materials (e.g.\ngraphite contains a capacity of 372 mAh/g). This study provides valuable\ninsights about the electronic characteristics of newly fabricated N-graphdiyne\nnanomaterials, rendering them as promising candidates to be used in the growing\nindustry of rechargeable storage devices.\n\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Generating outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"3d2f2d2742f34f16b87bf2f9126a954d"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Decoding outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"64e34c9193784e109828c4e7e574b36d"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\nActual Title: Five Proofs of Chernoff's Bound with Applications\nPredicted Title: On the Bound of Chernoff\nActual Abstract:   We discuss five ways of proving Chernoff's bound and show how they lead to\ndifferent extensions of the basic bound.\n\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Generating outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d1a0f3100ae64821b078b88d5c7bf79a"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"HBox(children=(HTML(value='Decoding outputs'), FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"179133edff94413c942f6694d0a6c68e"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\nActual Title: Charge Transfer Kinetics at the Solid-Solid Interface in Porous\n  Electrodes\nPredicted Title: Interfacial charge transfer in carbon-coated LiFePO4 porous electrode\nActual Abstract:   Interfacial charge transfer is widely assumed to obey Butler-Volmer kinetics.\nFor certain liquid-solid interfaces, Marcus-Hush-Chidsey theory is more\naccurate and predictive, but it has not been applied to porous electrodes.

The fitted\nreorganization energy matches the Born solvation energy for electron transfer\nfrom carbon to the iron redox site. The kinetics are thus limited by electron\ntransfer at the solid-solid (carbon-LixFePO4) interface, rather than by ion\ntransfer at the liquid-solid interface, as previously assumed.
