This paper provides a general framework to\nconvert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in\nconvex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The\nclass of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms\nfrom some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include\nwell-studied cases such as sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, as well as\nseveral others including sums of a few permutations matrices, low-rank tensors,\northogonal matrices, and atomic measures. The convex programming formulation is\nbased on minimizing the norm induced by the convex hull of the atomic set; this\nnorm is referred to as the atomic norm. The facial structure of the atomic norm\nball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering\nsimple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp\nestimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust\nrecovery of models from partial information. These estimates are based on\ncomputing the Gaussian widths of tangent cones to the atomic norm ball.

The quality of these\napproximations affects the number of measurements required for recovery.

To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of\nthe produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with\nelementary Collins modulation.

This results in big error accumulations\nwhen sensing the angle of joints between arms one by one. In addition, the\nsensing method based on machine vision is not suitable for such kind of outdoor\nworking situation yet. In this paper, we propose a novel posture positioning\nmethod for multi-joint manipulators based on wireless sensor network\nlocalization. The posture sensing problem is formulated as a\nNearest-Euclidean-Distance-Matrix (NEDM) model. The resulting approach is\nreferred to as EDM-based posture positioning approach (EPP) and it satisfies\nthe following guiding principles: (i) The posture of each arm segment on a\nmulti-joint manipulator must be estimated as accurately as possible; (ii) The\napproach must be computationally fast; (iii) The designed approach should not\nbe susceptible to obstructions. To further improve accuracy, we explore the\ninherent structure of manipulators, i.e., fixed-arm length. This is naturally\npresented as linear constraints in the NEDM model. For concrete pumps, a\ntypical multi-joint manipulator, the mechanical property that all arm segments\nalways lie in a 2D plane is used for dimension-reduction operation.

Next, high-precision\nmass and radius information should be combined with high-precision stellar\nabundance data, to constrain the exoplanet$'$s water content; those\nincompatible with less than 0.1 wt % H$_{2}$O can be deprioritized. Then,\nreflectance photometry or low-resolution transmission spectroscopy should\nconfirm an optically thin atmosphere.

By comparison with the previously estimated BH masses, the\nunderestimation of MBH is noticed with a mean factor 4-5 which depends on the\nmeasured full width. We proposed the new formula to estimate MBH in WLQs based\non their observed FWHM (H beta) and luminosities at 5100 A. In our opinion,\nWLQs are also normal quasars visible in a reactivation stage.\n"}, {"true_title": "Theoretical Investigation: 2D N-Graphdiyne Nanosheets as Promising Anode\n  Materials for Li/Na Rechargeable Storage Devices", "pred_title": "Newly fabricated N-graphdiyne monolayers as anode", "abstract": "  N-graphdiyne monolayers, a set of carbon-nitride nanosheets, have been\nsynthesized recently through the polymerization of triazine- and pyrazine-based\nmonomers. Since the two-dimensional nano-structures are mainly composed of\nlight-weight nonmetallic elements including carbon and nitrogen, they might be\nable to provide high storage capacities for rechargeable cells. In this study,\nwe used extensive first principle calculations such as electronic density of\nstates, band structure, adsorption energy, open-circuit voltage, nudged-elastic\nband and charge analyses to investigate the application of the newly fabricated\nN-graphdiyne monolayers as the anode material for Li/Na/Mg ion batteries. Our\ncalculations suggest that while Mg foreign atoms poorly interact with\nmonolayers, Li and Na adatoms illustrate outstanding anodic characteristics for\nrechargeable storage cells. Electronic density of states calculations indicate\nthat the insertion of Li/Na into the novel N-graphdiyne materials enhances the\nelectrical conductivity of nanosheets. Adsorption energy and open-circuit\nvoltage calculations predict that the nanosheets can provide a high storage\ncapacity spectrum of 623-2180 mAh/g which is higher than that for most recently\ndiscovered 2D materials (e.g. phosphorene, borophane, and germanene involve Li\nbinding capacities of 433, 504, and 369 mAh/g, respectively) and it is also\nsignificantly greater than the capacity of commercial anode materials (e.g.\ngraphite contains a capacity of 372 mAh/g). This study provides valuable\ninsights about the electronic characteristics of newly fabricated N-graphdiyne\nnanomaterials, rendering them as promising candidates to be used in the growing\nindustry of rechargeable storage devices.\n"}, {"true_title": "Five Proofs of Chernoff's Bound with Applications", "pred_title": "On the Bound of Chernoff", "abstract": "  We discuss five ways of proving Chernoff's bound and show how they lead to\ndifferent extensions of the basic bound.\n"}, {"true_title": "Charge Transfer Kinetics at the Solid-Solid Interface in Porous\n  Electrodes", "pred_title": "Interfacial charge transfer in carbon-coated LiFePO4 porous electrode", "abstract": "  Interfacial charge transfer is widely assumed to obey Butler-Volmer kinetics.\nFor certain liquid-solid interfaces, Marcus-Hush-Chidsey theory is more\naccurate and predictive, but it has not been applied to porous electrodes. Here\nwe report a simple method to extract the charge transfer rates in carbon-coated\nLiFePO4 porous electrodes from chronoamperometry experiments, obtaining curved\nTafel plots that contradict the Butler-Volmer equation but fit the\nMarcus-Hush-Chidsey prediction over a range of temperatures. The fitted\nreorganization energy matches the Born solvation energy for electron transfer\nfrom carbon to the iron redox site. The kinetics are thus limited by electron\ntransfer at the solid-solid (carbon-LixFePO4) interface, rather than by ion\ntransfer at the liquid-solid interface, as previously assumed. The proposed\nexperimental method generalizes Chidsey's method for phase-transforming\nparticles and porous electrodes, and the results show the need to incorporate\nMarcus kinetics in modeling batteries and other electrochemical systems.\n"}]
